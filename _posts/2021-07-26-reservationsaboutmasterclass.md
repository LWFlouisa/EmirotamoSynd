Before I mention my reservations, here is a link to the video that put the question in my mind: [SMA Masterclass](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=3d1H1uayHlA)

Presently my biggest reservation was the advertisement gives me the impression that traditional illustration tools are not allowed. I can draw digitally, but my present tablet is designed for a little kid.

Format is less of an issue, as I can draw on tall paper now. And the audition itself has no rule against traditional art as long as its transfered digitally.

Also my preference is lengthy one shots called Graphic Novels here in the west. And going forward going to focus on fictional language books.
